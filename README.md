The respository consists of three codes written in R-Script used to evaluate the global average for the period of 1981-2014 from the raw GCM monthly data. The details on the three files are as follows:
global_avg_model_ensemble.R: Run the code to calculate the global average (ensemble of 8 GCMs)
GridArea.R: Function used to calculate the grid area (to be saved in the same folder)
month_to_annual.R: Function used to convert monthly data to annual data (to be saved in the same folder)

Data Used: THe data can be doenloaded from the following links
